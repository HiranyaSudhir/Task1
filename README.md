# Task1
Implementing a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms

Project Description 
ðŸ”¹ Project Title: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
ðŸ”¹ Description:
Developed a machine learning model to predict house prices using a subset of features from the Kaggle housing dataset. Focused on key numerical attributes such as above-ground living area (GrLivArea), number of bedrooms (BedroomAbvGr), and full bathrooms (FullBath). Implemented the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation using Python.

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights:
Imported and analyzed a real-world dataset with over 1400+ training records.

Selected relevant features based on domain logic and correlation analysis.

Trained a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.

Evaluated model performance using RÂ² Score and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Visualized actual vs predicted prices using scatter plots.

Ensured reproducibility by using fixed random states and organized code structure.

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Technologies:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Google Colab
